# Welcome! This is my PET project

It is small mvp, where you can create an account that I will be securely stored in database. Also, you can add your
personal tasks that
will be linked to your account and be accessible on any logged in device

# Stack:

1. Nest Js for backend development (Authorization and Firebase integration)
2. React for UI part of the project
3. TypeScript as main frontend language
4. For creating and validating forms I have used `react-hoom-forms`
5. As a theme library I chose MUI
